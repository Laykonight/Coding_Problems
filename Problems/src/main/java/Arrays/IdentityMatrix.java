Question
Given an N/N sized matrix of numbers.
Find the maximum size of the Identity Matrix in the lower right corner.

An Identity Matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements of the
main diagonal are 1’s and all other elements are 0's.

Examples of expected behavior:

For the following matrix, the output is 1:
2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9
2 3 4 0
3 3 3 1

For the following matrix, the output is 2:
2 3 4 5
3 3 3 3
6 7 1 0
2 3 0 1

For the following matrix, the output is 3:
4 3 9 0 2
1 2 3 4 5
6 3 1 0 0
7 6 0 1 0
3 2 0 0 1
